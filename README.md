# OnlyYou

This is a camera that only capture you without other guys.

Usually when we take photos, especially when we are taking photos at some popular tourist attractions, there will be a lot of people in your photos' background. It's almost impossible for you to wait for the accurate moment to press the shutter. 

Now, you can use this project to process your photo to remove unwanted persons/dogs/cars...

That's why I call this project OnlyYou.
